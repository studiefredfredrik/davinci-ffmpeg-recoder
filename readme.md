# davinci-ffmpeg-recoder  
A small app that uses FFMPEG to convert video files of most formats  
to a format compatible with movie editing software DaVinci Resolve  


## Installation  
The executables for FFMPEG are not included in this repo, but the latest builds can be  
downloaded from [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)  
The latest builds as windows .exe are available on [https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)  

There is a folder in the repo called `put_ffmpeg_exe_and_ffprobe_exe_inside_here`  
where you need to put the downloaded `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` files.
